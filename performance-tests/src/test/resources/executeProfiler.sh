# The reason this script exists compared to just running the python3 command in
# vehicleInventoryService.execInContainer(command);
# is because execInContainer command is blocking. Profiler is running in an infinite while loop so it never returns.
# The way around this would be to run it in the background with &. However, running with & directly, it runs
# the command once and quits. This is just a simple workaround. Also, reason we are
# outputting to output.txt is that output logs of the script can be checked during the run inside the container.
