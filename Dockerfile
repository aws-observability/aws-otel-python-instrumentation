# This Docker file builds auto-instrumentation image for aws-otel-python-instrumentation following upstream Docker build instruction:
# https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/blob/main/autoinstrumentation/python/Dockerfile
#   The packages are installed in the `/autoinstrumentation` directory. This is required as when instrumenting the pod by CWOperator,
#   one init container will be created to copy all the content in `/autoinstrumentation` directory to app's container. Then
#   update the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable accordingly. Then in the second stage, copy the directory to `/autoinstrumentation`.

# Stage 1: Install ADOT Python in the /operator-build folder

# Remove opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc and grpcio, as grpcio has strict dependencies on the Python version and
# will cause confusing failures if gRPC protocol is used. Now if gRPC protocol is requested by the user, instrumentation
# will complain that grpc is not installed, which is more understandable. References:

# urllib3 recently made a release that drops support for Python 3.8
# Our sdk depends on botocore which pulls in the version of urllib3 based Python runtime it detects.
# The rule is that if current pip command version is > 3.9 botocore will pick up the latest urllib3,
# otherwise it picks up the older urllib3 that is compatible with Python 3.8.
# https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/develop/requirements-docs.txt
# Since this Dockerfile currently uses the fixed Python 3.11 base image to pull the required dependencies,
# EKS and ECS applications will encounter a runtime error for Python 3.8 compatibility.
# Our fix is to temporarily restrict the urllib3 version to one that works for all supported Python versions 
# that we currently commit to support (notably 3.8). 
# TODO: Remove this temporary workaround once we deprecate Python 3.8 support since it has reached end-of-life.
