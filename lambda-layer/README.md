# AWS Lambda Application Signals Support

This folder provides support for **Application Signals** in AWS Lambda environments. You can explore this repository to learn how to build a Lambda layer for AWS Python Runtimes from scratch in your AWS account. Alternatively, you can directly visit the AWS documentation, [Enable Application Signals on Lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Application-Signals-Enable-Lambda.html), and use the AWS-managed Lambda layers we provide.

## Features

- Supports Application Signals, including traces and metrics, for AWS Lambda Python Runtimes.
- Automates the deployment process, including the creation of the Application Python Lambda Layer and a sample Lambda function.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have installed and configured the following tools:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (to configure AWS credentials)

### Configure AWS Credentials

Ensure that your AWS credentials are properly configured in your local environment. You can use the following command with the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```
This will prompt you to enter your `AWS Access Key ID`, `AWS Secret Access Key`, `Default region name`, and `Default output format`.

## Installation and Deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```

### 2. Run the Build Script

Navigate to the `lambda-layer` folder and run the `build.sh` script. This will create the Application Python Lambda Layer and a Lambda sample app in your AWS account:

```bash
cd lambda-layer
./build.sh
```

## Lambda Sample App

Once the script has successfully run, you will see the deployed Lambda sample app in your AWS account. You can trigger the 
Lambda function and view the traces and metrics through the AWS CloudWatch Console.

## Configuration

By default the layer enable botocore and aws-lambda instrumentation libraries only for better Lambda cold start performance. To 
enable all opentelemetry python 
supported libraries you can set environment variable `OTEL_PYTHON_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS=none`. Refer to details in 
[OpenTelemetry Python Disabling Specific Instrumentations](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/python/configuration/#disabling-specific-instrumentations)
